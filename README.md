# _face_Mask_Detection_using_CNN
#Project Overview
I have build a deep learning system that can determine whether a person wearing mask or not wearing mask.
#Source Data
I have downloaded these dataset from kaggle.
#Work Flow
:-Data collection :-Image processing :-Train-Test-Split :-Model training :-Model evaluation
#Results
I achived an accuracy of 92% on convolutional neural network.so i have successfully build the predictive system which will predict person wearing mask or not.
